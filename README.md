# Python Examples with Sumeya Farah

This repository contain Python examples created by Flatiron Schools. Each example demonstrates a specific concept or problem-solving approach in Python programming.

## Examples

### 1. Converting 12-hour Time to 24-hour Time

Converts a time from the 12-hour format to the 24-hour format. It takes an hour, minute, and period (AM or PM) as input and returns the corresponding 24-hour time.

**File:** `clock.py`

### 2. Counting Positive Numbers

Checks if exactly two out of three integers are positive numbers. It takes three integers as input and returns `True` if exactly two are positive, and `False` otherwise.

**File:** `two_positive_numbers.py`

### 3. Highest Value of Consonant Substrings

Finds the highest value of consonant substrings in a lowercase string. Consonant substrings are calculated based on the alphabet values, excluding vowels.

**File:** `consonants.py`
